## 🚀 Getting Started

The fastest way to start using Storybook with SolidJS:

```bash
npx create-solid-storybook <folder-name>
```

Replace `<folder-name>` with your desired project directory name. This will generate a SolidJS project pre-configured with Storybook 9 and all essential addons.

Then run:

```bash
cd <folder-name>
npm run storybook
```

Open the provided URL in your browser to view your Storybook instance.
